# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence — Search Algorithms

This module focuses on **search algorithms**, a foundational concept in Artificial Intelligence (AI). These algorithms allow an AI agent to navigate a **state space** to find solutions, whether it’s a pathfinding task, game-playing strategy, or general problem-solving.

## 🔍 1. Uninformed (Blind) Search Algorithms

Uninformed search algorithms **do not use any knowledge** about the goal state other than its definition. They explore the search space blindly and are widely applicable to various problems.

### ✅ Algorithms Implemented:

| Algorithm | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** | Explores nodes level by level. Complete and optimal (for uniform cost). |
| **Depth-First Search (DFS)** | Explores as deep as possible before backtracking. Not guaranteed to find the shortest path. |
| **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)** | DFS with a fixed depth limit. Prevents infinite traversal. |
| **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)** | Repeated DLS with increasing depth. Combines DFS's space efficiency with BFS's completeness. |
| **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** | Expands the node with the lowest path cost. Guarantees optimality. |
| **Bidirectional Search** | Runs BFS from both the start and the goal and stops when the two meet. Efficient for known start and goal. |

## 💡 2. Informed (Heuristic) Search Algorithms

Informed search algorithms use **heuristics**—domain-specific knowledge—to guide the search toward the goal more efficiently.

### 🔜 Upcoming Algorithms:

| Algorithm | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Greedy Best-First Search** | Selects the node that appears closest to the goal based on a heuristic. Fast but may not find optimal solutions. |
| **A\* Search** | Uses both actual path cost and heuristic estimate. Complete and optimal with an admissible heuristic. |
| **Iterative Deepening A\*** | Combines A\*'s optimality with iterative deepening’s space efficiency. |
